## What contributions are we looking for?
In general we are looking for any contribution in writing content for a specific topics from a to-do lists in each file. These to-dos are placed in comments.

Beside that we also look for all contributions like:
- finding typos
- meritorical corrections

## What contributions we are NOT looking for?
One of our standards is avoiding redundancy. Therefore we won't accept a content that contains too many details.

## Standards
- **We avoid meaningless text**  
No one wants to read text that makes no sense. We avoid writing that line.

- **We make it simple as possible**  
We do not want to waste the reader's time. We make our articles as simple as possible, to enable easy understanding of it.

- **We avoid redundancy**  
Writing what has been written is not our goal. We aim to make a simple coding overview, and redirect a reader to a more explanatory sources if those exists.
